Analysis Overview

#### Functionality and Design:
•  Frontend: Built using React Native with Expo for mobile, providing a cross-platform experience.
•  Backend: Node.js with Express and MongoDB for database management and REST API endpoints. Secure JWT authentication for user sessions.
•  AI Services: Integration with Google Gemini AI for recipe generation and Recognize Anything API for image recognition.

#### Design and UX:
•  Comprehensive theming and accessibility have been considered, with successful updates to achieve full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
•  High contrast mode support, screen reader compatibility, and proper focus management are implemented.

Potential Improvements

#### Functionality and Code Structure:
1. State Management:
•  Break down large components like App.tsx into smaller, reusable components to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
•  Use React Query or Zustand for better state management.
2. Code Duplication:
•  Centralize form validation logic and modal design patterns to avoid redundancy.
•  Implement a central styling system to maintain consistent design across components.

#### iOS Compliance:
1. App Store Requirements:
•  Create app preview videos and ensure proper age rating setup.
•  Implement certificate pinning for secure API communications and verify content guideline adherence.
2. Security Enhancements:
•  Use expo-secure-store for token storage instead of AsyncStorage to improve security.
•  Implement a token expiration mechanism and certificate pinning for enhanced security.

#### Accessibility and UX:
1. Accessibility:
•  Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate labels, roles, and hints.
•  Provide support for larger text sizes and reduced motion preferences.
